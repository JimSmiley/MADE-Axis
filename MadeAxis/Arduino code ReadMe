Suggest using MadeAxis Wifi - contains bugfixes, especially in SliderToVal method to fix oscillation. Uses Open Sound Control over wifi instead of bluetooth,
which simplifies a number of things potentially.
Not yet tested with multiple madeAxis and the effect on latency and network congestion.
To Do: modify Hololens Application for wifi version.
